Issues to fix:
 - when adding new set for an exercise focus for the whole workout view should focus at the end of the add button for the end of
   the row that the new set was added. Likewise when a new exercise is added.

- Set TextViews can call the AlarmDialog again to edit the view? This would put it at the end? Maybe a new dialog? Or it can add a new member to carry location in view.
- Format the weight/reps data so it doesn't all blend together
- Format the exercise Name view so that it stands out.
- Add workout date, start time, and end time. Date and start time will be instantiated on workoutLogActivity start and
  end time will be added at workout end (workout end button?)

- data persistance... do we have a end workout button?
    - need to add delete for workouts also?

- screen navigation investigation
    - what happens to the workout when navigating back a screen - now since its stored in the DB it is rebuilt.
    -

- view past workouts
    - start with the load workout spawning a new WorkoutLogActivity. Later probably be should be combined in the WorkoutLogActivity with seperate fragements.
        This will allow to on small devices change easily between viewing different workouts compared to the current, and on large devices view side by side.

        - Test loading views with workouts that are completed and not completed.
        - Combine exercise view builder methods or create a factory?

- short click on exercise textview brings up info screen for recent weights/reps

- clone workouts
    - exercises only but no sets (completed clones will now be editable).

- handle Disposable objects

- data sync service to sync data to central database on wifi connection.

- make MainMenu the main activity.

- customize the Dialog layouts so they look better.

- add formatting to the load workout dialog. Make them like the number picker.

- view exercise info dialog
    - add formatting to the strings.
    - limit the size the dialog width can be and make horizontally scrollable.
    - make MAX_HEIGHT dimension dynamic to work for different size screens.

- move hard coded dimensions and text into resource files.
