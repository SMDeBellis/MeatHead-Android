Issues to fix:
 - when adding new set for an exercise focus for the whole workout view should focus at the end of the add button for the end of
   the row that the new set was added. Likewise when a new exercise is added.

- Set TextViews can call the AlarmDialog again to edit the view? This would put it at the end? Maybe a new dialog? Or it can add a new member to carry location in view.
- Format the weight/reps data so it doesn't all blend together
- Format the exercise Name view so that it stands out.
- Add workout date, start time, and end time. Date and start time will be instantiated on workoutLogActivity start and
  end time will be added at workout end (workout end button?)

- data persistance... do we have a end workout button?
    - need to add delete methods to doas for removal when user removes sets and exercises. Maybe workouts also?




- data sync service to sync data to central database on wifi connection.
