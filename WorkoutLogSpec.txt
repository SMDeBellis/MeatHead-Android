Workout:
Date

Weighted Exercises
Non Weighted Exercises



Issues to fix:
 - when adding new set for an exercise focus for the whole workout view should focus at the end of the add button for the end of
   the row that the new set was added. Likewise when a new exercise is added.

- Disable add weight/reps button until all data is filled in the last one. -- or have a AlarmDialog pop up to populate before adding.
  Then they can be TextViews vs EditText. And the TextViews can call the AlarmDialog again to edit the view.
- Disable Add exercise until all data of the last weight/rep is filled in.
- Format the weight/reps data so it doesn't all blend together
- Format the exercise Name view so that it stands out.
- Add workout date, start time, and end time. Date and start time will be instantiated on workoutLogActivity start and
  end time will be added at workout end (workout end button?)

- data persistance... do we have a end workout button?
