Non Weighted Exercises



Issues to fix:
 - when adding new set for an exercise focus for the whole workout view should focus at the end of the add button for the end of
   the row that the new set was added. Likewise when a new exercise is added.

- Set TextViews can call the AlarmDialog again to edit the view? This would put it at the end? Maybe a new dialog? Or it can add a new member to carry location in view.
- Format the weight/reps data so it doesn't all blend together
- Format the exercise Name view so that it stands out.
- Add workout date, start time, and end time. Date and start time will be instantiated on workoutLogActivity start and
  end time will be added at workout end (workout end button?)

- data persistance... do we have a end workout button?
    - need to add delete for workouts also?

- screen navigation investigation
    - what happens to the workout when navigating back a screen
    -

- view past workouts
    - start with the load workout screen spawning a new Activity. Later probably be should be combined in the WorkoutLogActivity with seperate fragements.
        This will allow to on small devices change easily between viewing different workouts compared to the current, and on large devices view side by side.

        //Do this one first thing as it will make manual testing easier.
        - add finish button on workout log screen
                    - button will create the enddate timestamp and update the database. Will I need to create a new query?
                    - button will navigate back to the MainMenuActivity (or WorkoutLogMenu?)


        - Test loading views with workouts that are completed and not completed.
        - Combine workout builder methods or create a factory?



        - if workout is incomplete it can be modified if it has been finished then its view only.


- handle Disposable objects

- data sync service to sync data to central database on wifi connection.



Tasks for view past workouts:
Create Alert dialog with dropdown containing workout selections from database
Modify WorkoutLogActivity to be able to construct workout from database.
Capture alert dialog positive and negative clicks in workout menu screen. If workout is unfinished pass a modifiable flag to intent telling
    workoutLogActivity to add modification functionality or not.
